# Signal-Simulator-Demo-Mode
Magisk module that simulates signal and network by taking advantage of the Android demo mode that is randomized every 30 seconds


NOTICE: THIS MODULE DOES NOT PROVIDE A REAL NETWORK OR SIGNAL; IT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF ANDROID'S DEMO MODE.


If you want to change the randomization time, extract the module and open service.sh. In the last lines, change sleep 30 to the number of seconds you want, e.g., 15.
